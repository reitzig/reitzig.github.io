These are the files of my website, accessible at [reitzig.github.io](https://reitzig.github.io).

Find the sources in [their own branch](https://github.com/reitzig/reitzig.github.io/tree/sources).
Some plugins I wrote may be of independent interest, in particular

 * [`textcite`](https://github.com/reitzig/reitzig.github.io/blob/sources/_plugins/textcite.rb) for [Jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar),
 * one for [translating inline TikZ code into images](https://github.com/reitzig/reitzig.github.io/blob/sources/_plugins/tikz.rb), and
 * [signing everything with PGP](https://github.com/reitzig/reitzig.github.io/blob/sources/_plugins/pgp-sign.rb).

The [license statement from the website](http://reitzig.github.io/about/) carries over.
