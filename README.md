# reitzig.github.io

These are the files of my website, accessible at [reitzig.github.io](https://reitzig.github.io).
Its purpose is to communicate what I am up to professionally.

The site is driven by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby tool for generating static websites. 
I wrote more on my choice of tools and design decisions [here](https://reitzig.github.io/ramblings/2015/a-researchers-jekyll).
Find the sources in [their own branch](https://github.com/reitzig/reitzig.github.io/tree/sources).
Some snippets and plugins I wrote may be of independent interest, in particular

 * [opt-in integration of Disqus comments](https://github.com/reitzig/reitzig.github.io/blob/sources/_includes/protected-disqus.html),
 * [`textcite`](https://github.com/reitzig/reitzig.github.io/blob/sources/_plugins/textcite.rb) for [Jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar),
 * one for [translating inline TikZ code into images](https://github.com/reitzig/reitzig.github.io/blob/sources/_plugins/tikz.rb), and
 * [signing everything with PGP](https://github.com/reitzig/reitzig.github.io/blob/sources/_plugins/pgp-sign.rb) ([background](http://reitzig.github.io/ramblings/2015/signing-websites)).

The [license statement from the website](http://reitzig.github.io/about/) carries over.
