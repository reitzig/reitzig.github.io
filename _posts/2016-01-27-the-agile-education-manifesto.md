[Gunter Dueck](http://www.omnisophie.com) is one of my favorite voices on
(and off, I guess) the internet.

In a 
  [recent blog article](http://www.omnisophie.com/dd256-agile-erziehung-oder-the-agile-education-manifesto-januar-2016/)
he observes that while we[^1] have embraced the paradigm of 
  [agile software development](http://agilemanifesto.org/),
we have not thought to transfer the ideas to an arguably more critical application:
education.

He proposes the *Manifesto for Agile Education*:
{% marginnote "disclaimer_transl" "Translation mine, using [the original](http://agilemanifesto.org/)."%}

> We are uncovering better ways of developing people by doing it and helping
> others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:

> Individual development as a human over moving up grades according to standards. 

> Activating feelings of self-efficacy over documenting exams and reports. 

> Piquing and following curiosity over following curricula. 

> Ensuring education is fit for the future over maintaining vintage beliefs.

> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

Now that's a nice thought.
