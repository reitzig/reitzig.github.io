{% newthought "Last winter," %} I tried to 
  [engage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning)
a small group of students in class by using a method of active learning: 
  [audience response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_response). 
The idea is that you ask reasonably scoped questions during your presentation or 
discussion and have the audience respond, typically using some technology that 
enables quick and accurate counting as well as anonymity (at least among students).

There are many implementations to choose from: proprietary or free, using dedicated 
hardware (often called "clickers") or phone/web apps, multiple-choice only or 
with free input, and so on.
I wanted to pick something that was free for both me and the students, 
easy to use for everybody, and came with a decent interface.
{% marginnote "clicker" "I tried getting the clicker system a neighboring group has to work on my Ubuntu machine. No luck." %}

I stumbled over 
  [Plickers](http://plickers.com). 
It's probably *the* most low-tech and robust audience-response system you can 
imagine: you select a question you have typed up before, students hold up cards 
with something like  QR codes on them, you scan the room with your tablet or 
phone camera, and that is it.

You can choose to view answers by student or aggregated statistics. You manage 
questions and record sheets in the web application which also provides the 
live view you project in the classroom.

{% newthought "Plickers is free," %} and students do not need to have any 
special device, only an easily replaced paper card.

The technology works easily and properly; I had not a single issue after a grace 
period of getting used to the tool. I'd like to have support for mathematical 
formulae in questions and answers, but well. Note that the system is by design 
limited to multiple-choice questions with at most four answers; depending on 
what you want to do, this may be a serious dealbreaker.

My intention was to kick off discussions by asking rather open-ended questions 
on the literature the students were supposed to have worked through before we met. 
We usually went through the answers, starting with me asking: "Why (not) A?" 
That worked out really well; lots of teachable moments emerged. 
When I had no questions one week, some attendees expressed disappointment:
they had gotten used to the approach quickly and liked it.

{% newthought I can %} heartily recommend using audience response to *support* 
your teaching style and *engage* students. 
{% marginnote "use" "I disagree with using it for assessment." %}
I can recommend Plickers if you can live with its limitations and your class is 
not too large.

And, come to think of it: Since you can just hand out Plickers cards and get
started, this system has the potential to spice up *any* presentation.
Do you dare using audience response at a conference?
