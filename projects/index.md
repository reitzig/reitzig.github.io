## Hobby Projects

### Ongoing

Several drafts and ideas are floating around in my notes space -- stay tuned!

Most of what I do these days is on
    [Github](https://github.com/reitzig),
including things too minor to list here.

### On Hiatus

 * *[ltx2any](https://github.com/reitzig/ltx2any)*
    (2012--)
 
    Yet another LaTeX build wrapper, with one or two nifty features.
    
    This long-time project used to be driven by my own needs, which
    have -- sadly! -- mostly gone away after leaving academia.
    My intention is to clean it up, give it a proper name, and release
    version 1.0 -- I just can not say when (or if, to be honest) that 
    will happen.

### Concluded

 * *[Tools for Demon Hunters RPG](https://github.com/reitzig/dh-tools)*
    (2016--2017)
 
    Tools to help GMs and players of the Demon Hunters RPG create useful 
    supplements with little effort. 

 * *[bib2tpl](https://github.com/reitzig/bib2tpl)*
    (2010--2012)
 
    PHP library for creating citation and publication lists from BibTeX.
    
There are a couple of pre-historic projects the code of which never saw the 
light of the internet, and that is probably for the better.
Traces of those *are* still on the net; happy hunting!

## Work Projects

### Ongoing

 * **Tech Talks**
 
    Since November 2017, I have been organizing a roughly bi-weekly series of 
    knowledge-transfer sessions (internal).
    I also (co-)held the following sessions:
    
     * Kotlin -- A hands-on introduction (Jan 12th, 2018)
     * Git -- Basics, demystified (Dec 1st, 2017)

 * [**HealthDataSpace SDK**](https://sdk.healthdataspace.org)
 
    Easy access to the features of 
        [HealthDataSpace](https://app.healthdataspace.de) 
    from iOS and macOS apps, providing file storage with certified data 
    privacy for ehealth apps.
    
    - I gave a talk titled *Secure Infrastructure for the Mobile Legion*
      at
        [eHealth Innovation Days 2017](https://ehealth-innovation.net/history/ehealth-innovation-days-2017.html).
