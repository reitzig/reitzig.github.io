  title: My Research
---

My interests are best described as design and analysis of practical algorithms
and data structures using methods from my rigorous theory background. That is,
I want to find solutions to algorithmic problems that work *in practice*, and
analyze them as rigorously as possible in a suitable model.

The goal is that results of formal analysis can predict real behavior at least
relatively so that we can check hypotheses with experiments. The methods
championed by Donald E. Knuth, Robert Sedgewick and Philippe Flajolet seem
to be of particular use in this regard.

One particular interest of mine is doing the above for *parallel* settings.
This has yet to bear concrete fruit.

Other than that, I regularly get [nerd-sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by other 
interesting problems and questions of folklore, both of which abound in the field.
<!-- TODO give some links to corr. products? -->

I have collected some [open questions](open-questions).
