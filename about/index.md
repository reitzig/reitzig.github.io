  title: About Me

<img src="/assets/img/reitzig.jpg" alt="Raphael Reitzig" class="main-portrait" />
University has made me into a computer scientist with mostly theoretical viewpoints
but an interest in practical problem solving.
I enjoy teaching, 
  [programming](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/reitzig)
and working (or procrastinating) with {% latex %}, 
and I try to make the internet a 
  [better place for computer scientists](http://cs.stackexchange.com/users/98/raphael).

In the past, I was a junior researcher at the 
  [University of Kaiserslautern](http://wwwagak.cs.uni-kl.de/home/staff/raphael-reitzig).
Now, my pursuits in computer science are purely recreational.

After work, I engage in several nerdisms, {% abbr eg %} reading, music as well as
video and tabletop games. And some more [programming](https://github.com/akerbos).
For a healthy balance, I usually cook my own meals, 
work out (body-weight strength training, HIIT, running) 
and pursue a changing mix of bouldering, ultimate frisbee, ballroom dancing and 
team handball.

When you send me an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}), 
please consider signing or even encrypting with PGP.
You can find my key 
  [here](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x12F79CC14F0B50B9).
I sign as a matter of principle;
if you receive an email that seems to be from me but has *not* been signed with this key,
I *am probably not the author*.
