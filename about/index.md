  title: About Me
---

<img src="/assets/img/reitzig.jpg" alt="Raphael Reitzig" class="main-portrait" />
University has made me into a computer scientist with mostly theoretical viewpoints
but an interest in practical problem solving.
I enjoy teaching, 
  [programming](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/reitzig)
and working (or procrastinating) with {% latex %}, 
and I try to make the internet a 
  [better place for computer scientists](http://cs.stackexchange.com/users/98/raphael).

In the past, I was a junior researcher at the 
  [University of Kaiserslautern](http://wwwagak.cs.uni-kl.de/home/staff/raphael-reitzig).
Now my pursuits in computer science are purely recreational.
Instead I help pushing digitalization in health care by building software at
  [Digithurst](http://www.digithurst.de)/[Telepaxx](http://www.telepaxx.de).

After work, I engage in several nerdisms, {% abbr eg %} reading, music, and all kinds of
games. And some more
    [programming](https://github.com/reitzig).
For a healthy balance, I usually cook my own meals, cycle to work, and
play ultimate frisbee.

When you send me an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}), 
please consider signing or even encrypting with PGP.
You can find my key 
  [here](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x12F79CC14F0B50B9).
I sign as a matter of principle;
if you receive an email that seems to be from me but has *not* been signed with this key,
I *am probably not the author*.

### Credits

I thank the maintainers and contributors of the open source projects that
have been used to create these pages:

 * [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with
 
    * [Tufte theme](http://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll),
    * [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar),
    
   and many more components,
   
 * [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/),
 * [Academicons](http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) and
 * [Citation Style Language](http://citationstyles.org/).

Furthermore, I have been using the following services:

 * [Github](https://github.com),
 * [Disqus](https://disqus.com) and
 * [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/).


### Data Privacy

These sites were generated _statically_; there is no user interaction.
As such, no visitor data is collected.
I also do not use any tracking services.
In summary, I do not get any data about you.

Since the website is hosted on Github Pages, the corporate entity
Github, Inc. is in principle able to collect metadata such as you
visiting this page.

Third parties may track you through Javascript included here.
A complete listing of all services linked from these sites follows.

 * MathJax via domains `cdn.mathjax.org` and `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`.  
   Used for rendering mathematics. Probably innocuous.
 * Disqus via domains `disqus.com` and `disquscdn.com`.  
   Provides commenting features; opt-in. They _certainly_ track you as part of
   the services provided, so be aware when you enable comments.

I recommend using a script blocker like
    [uMatrix](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/)
to configure exactly which services you want to have included where.


### Disclaimer

I deny any responsibility for comments by visitors and content on external sites I link to.
You can not prevent others from producing sick things, right?

I am -- for better or worse -- responsible for these pages here, though.
Please contact me if you feel that your personal rights or business plans are violated by the content I provide;
I almost surely do not intend to do so. Thank you.

Any opinions I voice on these pages is solely my own.
